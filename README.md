# Shelly BLU Wireless Door Sensor API Integration Script
This javascript project enabled the integrate of a Shelly BLUE wireless door sensor with Viewtron IP camera NVR. This is done via the custom script feature of Shelly BLU sensors and the HTTP Post / webhook API available on Viewtron NVRs. Please note that the script can easily be modified so that it can be used to integrate any device with the Shelly window / door sensor. The device just must support an HTTP Post / webhook API.
